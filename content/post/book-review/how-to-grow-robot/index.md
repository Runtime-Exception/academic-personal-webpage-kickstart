### Summary
This book discusses different aspects about building a developmental robot. The author discusses all the concepts in a very easy to understand manner. In chapter 11 and 12 it discusses about the groundwork and developmental approach for growing a robot.

Ground work:
There were some remarkable robots in early 1950s but they were single task specific. But single task specific robots cannot help with human like intelligence. Robots engineered for tasks will not be humanlike. The physical anatomy influences the thought and cognitive development. So, they should be humanlike.
