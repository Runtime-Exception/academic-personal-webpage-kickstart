### Summary

This book tried to explain nicely 'How the mind works?', in a lucid approach. According to the book, the mind is a collection of smaller processes. He calls these processes '**Agents**'. 

These agents acts like members of a society. Each has it's own job to do, each interacts with its neighbor frequently but  has some connection with agents at distant. There is a hierarchy like city administrations, where agent at upper level gets orders from above and gets the job done via the subordinate agents. Like for building agent  it might use other smaller agents to build a tower using block. But the builder agent itself might be a subpart of higher level agents like Play agent.

**My thoughts:**
Although the book tried to explain many concepts about human mind, the explanations are mostly hypothetical. It doesn't provide much supporting references. But still, it paved some ideas about hierarchical or circular connections between subcomponents where higher level doesn't care about the goal or other details of lower level. This might be useful in decoding intelligence modeling.
