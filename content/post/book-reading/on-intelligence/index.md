### Summary

This book amazingly presents some top-down mechanisms on how the human brain works, how it is so intelligent.

**The Brain**

Chapter 3 discusses about the brain structure, the _neocortex_ mainly. Human neocortex is a six layer structure with billions of neurons connected in some hierarchical way. The connections probably sum up to trillions. Though the there is a hierarchy of layers, it is not literal hierarchy. Mostly based on the information flow direction. Like visual pattern signals reach first at V1 layer, then passed to V2 and so on. There are different functional regions in the brain that perform different functions like visual, auditory, touch etc. But if these regions are rewired to different sensory inputs, they should work fine. This suggests, _"the brain works in some universal cortical algorithm"_. There are also lateral connection between different areas of the hierarchy. So, this is more like a heterarchy. There are some association regions, where different sensory connections are combined. For example, in one layer, both vision and touch areas might be connected. This are called association area. The brain receive only patterns of signals. These patterns are stored memory.

**Memory**

In chapter 4, the author discuss memory functionality. Neurons are very slow compared to current computers. Yet, it outperforms the super fast computers in many aspects. The author believes the memory is behind this speed of neurons. Brain doesn't compute, it recalls from the memory. Hence it is fast. The entire cortex is a memory system, not a computer. And the signals are stored with an invariant representation. This way, it can recognize a previously experienced signals even though each time the raw signal is different in many ways from the stored representations. There are 4 attributes of neocortical memory - 
- It stores sequence of patterns
- Recalls patterns auto-associatively
- stores patterns in an invariant form
- stores patterns in a hierarchy
