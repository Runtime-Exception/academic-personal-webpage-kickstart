### Summary
This article summarizes the titled paper on [The Winograd Schema Challenge](https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WSKR2012.pdf)

This paper proposes an alternative to turing test, but it follows Turing's idea to judge only the behaviour as measure of intelligence. One drawback of the Turing test is that the final judgement for the same set of questions and answers will vary for different judges. They tried to avoid such a case. This challenge will provide quantitive measure of the 'Intelligence'
