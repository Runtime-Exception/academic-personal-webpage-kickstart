In our last class of Human Level Artificial Intelligence (HLAI), Professor Dr. Park presented on 'Towards Human Level AI'. He discussed on how we can approach towards building human level intelligent robot. The talk was divided in three parts - The theory, Test, and Model.

**The theory**:
In this part, he discussed related terms and background on intelligence. To build an _'Intelligent'_ agent we first need to define or understand clearly, what is _'Intelligence'_. Based on the [Universal Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3329.pdf) - 

>Intelligence measures an agentâ€™s ability to **achieve goals** in a **wide range of environments**.

He the discussed three levels of intelligence:
- **Level 1**: In this level there is no individual learning. It is refined by evolution. (Ex- Earthworm). The problem with this kind is that, evolution is too slow.
- **Level 2**: Animals in this level can learn from direct experience. And the learning can be refined based on rewards. (Ex-rats, dogs). The problem is they cannot pass their learning to next generation.
- **Level 3**: In this level, the learning is possible from indirect experience too. Like using language. (Ex. Human). This learning can also be shared with others with language.

He then presented formal definition of HLAI as:

>An agent has a human-level artificial intelligence if _there exists a symbolic description for every feasible sensory input and agent action sequence_, such that the agent _can update the behavior policy equally_ whether it receives the symbolic description or it experience the sensory input and the action sequence itself.
