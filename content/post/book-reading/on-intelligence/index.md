### Summary

This book amazingly presents some top-down mechanisms on how the human brain works, how it is so intelligent.

**The Brain**

Chapter 3 discusses about the brain structure, the _neocortex_ mainly. Human neocortex is a six layer structure with billions of neurons connected in some hierarchical way. The connections probably sum up to trillions. Though the there is a hierarchy of layers, it is not literal hierarchy. Mostly based on the information flow direction. Like visual pattern signals reach first at V1 layer, then passed to V2 and so on. There are different functional regions in the brain that perform different functions like visual, auditory, touch etc. But if these regions are rewired to different sensory inputs, they should work fine. This suggests, the brain works in some universal cortical algorithm.
